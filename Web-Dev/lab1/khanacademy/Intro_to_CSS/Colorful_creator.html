        <p>The <em> The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera,</em> native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs.
         Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized and large ungulates.<strong></strong> The lion is an apex and keystone predator.</strong>.</p>

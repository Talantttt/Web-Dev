        <h1>Travel to the Great Blue Hole</h1>

        <p class="great">Although it is not strictly for those faint at heart, visiting and, if possible, diving into<strong>The Great Blue Hole</strong>
            should -and probably is- be on everyone’s bucket list. This giant marine sinkhole off the coast of Belize is over 100 meters deep with a surface area of over 70 thousand square meters wide. It is the most significant sea hole in the world and is almost perfectly circular, making for quite the incredible view when flying over it.

            Naturally, thanks to its mesmerizing nature and the even more mesmerizing underwater experience, the Belize Great Blue Hole was chosen to be a UNESCO World Heritage Site, part of the second-largest barrier reef in the world after Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. 
            <em>Belize’s Great Blue Hole </em>was also ranked as the #1 most fantastic place on Earth by the Discovery Channel in 2012. So it is safe to say that it is entirely worth the trip.
